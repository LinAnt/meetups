description: "<p>Cloud Native tech and Kubernetes goes Turku! Cloud Native and Kubernetes
  Turku is the official Cloud Native Computing Foundation Meetup group about the technologies
  hosted under CNCF umbrella. Furthermore, we're part of the Cloud Native Nordics
  family, an umbrella for the Cloud Native meetups in the Nordic countries. Join our
  Slack here: <a href=\"https://cloudnativenordics.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://cloudnativenordics.com</a></p>
  \n<p>We host talks from anyone doing cool things with Kubernetes, and the other
  CNCF technologies, including companies using them in production or vendors who are
  pushing the boundaries of what the cloud native techs can do.</p> \n<p>Presentations
  will be focused on introduction slides, guides, workshops, adoption stories and
  demos, but not sales pitches. The meetup will be organized in an open and democratic
  way, where anyone that wants to help out organizing or speaking will be truly welcome.</p>
  \n<p>To become a venue sponsor or speaker, please reach out to us!</p> \n<p>This
  meetup's official language is English; the conversations and presentations will
